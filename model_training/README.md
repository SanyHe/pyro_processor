# STRUCTURE
+ dataset: it contains data set used for training the machine learning models of different patterns respectively;
+ images: it contains the diagram reflecting correlations between the abundances in both the training and test datasets and those predicted by machine learning models;
+ models: it contains trained models produced by the code in 【model_training.ipynb】
+ model_training.ipynb: the code to train machine learning models
